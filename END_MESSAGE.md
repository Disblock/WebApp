Hi @everyone !

# What's happening ?

Disblock has been running for now around 3 years ! I'm really proud of all the time we spent together building and creating, but unfortunalety, all good things eventually come to an end. For multiple reasons I'll explain in this message, I'm thinking of shutting Disblock down July, 31st (07/31).

# Why ? '-'

## Lack of time
As time passes, I'm more and more busy with school, others projects, and other tasks that keep me from working on the bot. I would have loved working with other people on this project, but Disblock didn't met the success I hoped for when starting it.

Since I'm not working regulary on it, the project is growing older, and Discord is always bringing us new features, which would require a permanent flow of updates and improvements. As for now, I'm hardly in capacity to follow the rhythm of Discord updates.

## Bad code quality
When I created Disblock, I was just starting my bachelor's degree in computer science, not very aware of the importance of keeping everything well organised. As a result, developers who want to join the project may struggle to understand the structure of the project and the hierarchy between those hundreds of files.
As I graduated and entered a Master's degree, I now clearly see that I should make a giant refactoring, which would take a considerable amount of time

## Deprecation of the current codebase
Disblock is dependent on a lot of modules, `discord.js` for example. While updates are released to such modules, it become harder to maintain the dependencies up to dates and secure. New features added to Discord are also a difficulty, as we need to manage those in the already complicated codebase.

Another event that is difficult to manage is the deprecation of `vm2` module, that was in charge of running workspaces code in a sandbox. That's not the only security in place, so there is not immediate danger, but that's something in the TODO list that would take *a very long* time.

## Lack of users
When I started building Disblock, ChatGPT and others AI were not available, and building his own Discord bot was something only for people with coding skills. Disblock was a tentative to solve this by providing a convenient way to build a bot easily without learning to program.
Unfortunately, Disblock never really had a community, and stayed a small project hidden somewhere in the last pages of bots listing websites.

I am really, really thankful towards the 218 servers that installed and tried Disblock. Sadly, that's not a lot compared to others bots. I guess I'm lacking communication skills to promote this project '-'

## Hosting costs
With energy prices increasing, hosting cost gradually increased, from 6€/month in mid-2022, to 8.7€/month today. Well, that's not a lot, Disblock is pretty light, and managing only a few hundreds of servers doesn't require an expensive hosting plan. From June 2022 (start of the real hosting) to now, the total hosting cost is **279.25€**.
-# That's more than 1€ per server that added Disblock :smiling_face_with_tear: 

I could also add the top.gg advertisement cost, but that's only a few dozens €.
In the meanwhile, I never earned money from Disblock, premium status wasn't implemented as the project is not reliable enough.

# What's next ?
I'm really sad to write this, but **Disblock will be shutting down on July, 31st.**
This also means that everything stored in our databases will be deleted, including workspaces, events, values stored, ect...

> If you need to backup values storage (for your server economy, or anything else), you can create a #economy-backup channel where users can send a message, and the bot respond with their amount of currency. In a last resort, I can also try to extract values stored for you.
>
> If anyone really loves this project and want to continue it, I really encourage to do so, but that would be a difficult task. Feel free to use the code base as you want, everything is MIT licensed.

Users could host their own copy of Disblock, but today, it would be easier to ask ChatGPT to generate a simple bot and place it on a cheap VPS.

Another services to create bots without coding are also operating ! Like https://botghost.com/, https://www.botstudioo.com/, https://inventor.gg/, ect... I never tried those platforms, so I can't say if they are good or not though.

# TLDR
Thanks for everything we did together in this project :heart: !
On July, 31st, Disblock will be closed, and this discord server probably removed.
